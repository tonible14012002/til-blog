## 1. Introduction (2 trang) [Khoa’s survey](https://www.notion.so/Khoa-s-survey-556593aa337c45ea9c5c4c8a158fa87a?pvs=21) (T7 25/11)
### 1.1 Motivation ✅
### 1.3 Scope and Objectives of the Project ✅

## 2. Technological Foundations (T7 25/11)
### 2.1 Deep learning Basics @Nam Anh Bui ✅
#### 2.1.1 Deep Learning Overview ( Classifier problem, detection … ) ✅
##### 2.1.1.1 Neural Networks ✅
##### 2.1.1.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ✅
- Convolutional Operation ✅
- Convolutional Neural Network ✅
- Pooling Layer ✅
- Feature Map ✅
- Object Detector Problem [ ]

##### 2.1.1.3 Graph Convolutional Network @Phú Xuân ✅

### 2.2 Human Pose Estimation (T5, 30/11)
#### 2.2.1 Data Preprocessing [Khoa’s survey](https://www.notion.so/Khoa-s-survey-556593aa337c45ea9c5c4c8a158fa87a?pvs=21)  ✅
- Image Resizing and Normalization: Images are often resized to a specific input size suitable for the pose detection model. Normalization may be applied to standardize pixel values.
- Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are used to augment the training dataset, improving the model's generalization.

#### 2.2.2 Pose Detection Model: [Khoa’s survey](https://www.notion.so/Khoa-s-survey-556593aa337c45ea9c5c4c8a158fa87a?pvs=21) ✅
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Deep learning models, especially CNNs, are widely used for pose detection. The architecture may include multiple convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features.
- Architectures for Pose Detection: Popular architectures include Hourglass Networks, OpenPose, PoseNet, and HRNet, each designed to capture spatial relationships and hierarchical features relevant to human pose.

#### 2.2.3 Heatmap Regression: [Nam Anh survey](https://www.notion.so/Nam-Anh-survey-5eed290e1c6b495d8cd4d80111f08354?pvs=21) 
- Joint Heatmaps: For 2D pose estimation, joint positions are often represented as heatmaps. Each heatmap corresponds to the likelihood of a joint's presence in a specific location.

#### 2.2.4 Part Affinity Fields (PAFs): ✅
- PAFs for Limb Connections: PAFs connect pairs of joints, indicating the likelihood of a limb existing between them. They help refine joint positions and capture the spatial relationships between joints.

#### 2.2.5 Post-Processing: [Nam Anh survey](https://www.notion.so/Nam-Anh-survey-5eed290e1c6b495d8cd4d80111f08354?pvs=21) 
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): To remove redundant and closely located joint predictions, NMS is applied. It retains only the most confident predictions for each joint.

#### 2.2.6 Skeleton Representation: [Nam Anh survey](https://www.notion.so/Nam-Anh-survey-5eed290e1c6b495d8cd4d80111f08354?pvs=21) 
- Connecting Joints: After detecting joints, a skeleton representation is formed by connecting adjacent joints with lines, representing the limbs.

#### 2.2.7 Output Format: Khoa
- Joint Coordinates: The final output includes the estimated coordinates (x, y) of each joint in the image. In 3D pose estimation, depth information (z) is also included.

#### 2.2.8 Multi-Person Pose Detection: @Phú Xuân ✅
- Person Detection: In multi-person pose detection, a person detection model is often used to identify and locate individuals in the image before estimating their poses individually.

#### 2.2.9 Attention Mechanisms (Optional): @Phú Xuân ✅
- Attention for Body Parts: Some models may incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on specific body parts or regions of interest during the pose detection process.

#### 2.2.10 Dataset @Phú Xuân ✅
- Annotated Pose Dataset: Training and evaluating pose detection models require datasets with annotated images containing ground truth pose information.

#### 2.2.11 Human Fall Detection [Khoa’s survey](https://www.notion.so/Khoa-s-survey-556593aa337c45ea9c5c4c8a158fa87a?pvs=21)
