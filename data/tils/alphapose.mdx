> The post below is just a summarize version of a survey which I'm studying. The goal is to understand AlphaPose for my school project about Human fall detection.

## Introduction

Full body haman pose estimation is one of the fundamentals in computer visions field. With many different applications derived from it.

<Callout>
The survey only focus on top-down approach, which first detects human bounding boxes and then estimates the pose for each box.
</Callout>

## Top-Down Framework
#### Limitation
- __Top down__ approach's performances are dominant on common benchmarks.
- Detection state and esimator are separated so if Detection fail => No recover for the pose estimator.

#### Solutions
- Lower the detection confidence and NMS threshold _(can raise redundant boxes)_.
- Eliminated redundant boxes by a parametric pose NMS _(Using novel pose distance metric to compare pose similarity)_.
- Optimize with a data-diven approach .
- Speed up top-down framework by a multi-stage concurrent pipeline in AlphaPose that enable running in realtime.

## AlphaPose Improvement
- __AlphaPose__ use a novel summetric integral keypoints regression method that can localize keypoints in different scales accurately.
- Extend pose guided proposal generator to in coporate with Multi-Domain Knowledge Distillation - incorporate training data from separate body part datasets.
- Novel part-guided humanproposal generator (PGPG) to augment training samples.
- Annotate new whole-body post estimation benchmark (136 points for each person).
- A Pose-aware identity embedding - enable simultaneous human pose tracking. A person re-id branch is attached on pose estimator.

This design allowing realtime Pose estimation and tracking in an unified manner.

## Whole-Body Keypoint Localization
#### Limitation of many Previous Methods
Goal: unified detectoin of body, face, hand, foot keypoints for multi-person.
- __Openpose__ - detecs body keypoints using PAFs. Then, estimate face landmarks and hand keypoints using two separate networks -> Such design consumes extra computation resources and time inefficient. 
- __Hidalgo__ using single network for whole body estimate -> Output resolution is limited and decrease performence on fine-level keypoints (faces, handes).
- __ZoomNet__ - ROIAlign to crop hand, face region on feature maps then predict keypoints on resized one.

All methods above use heatmap for keypoints representation.

#### Heatmap Limitation
- One of the major problem is __Quantization error__.
- Unsuitable for __Localizing keypoints__ of body, faces, hands simultaneously.
- __Draw back__ - Although Heatmaps are mostly used for keypoint representation. However, its size is usually quater of the input image. 
- Heatmap representation is discrete so it may miss the correct position (__not a problem in body-only estimation__. However not good for fine-level keypoints on hands, face).

> Use __additional sub-networks__ for hand and face estimation and ROI-Align to enlarge the feature map are current solutions. However, both methods are computation expensive (especially for full body estimation).

#### Adopt Soft-Argmax For keypoints Representation
Many works have proved that __Soft-argmax__ based integral regression is more suitable for whole-body keypoints. However, studies show some drawback of using soft-argmax.

###### Issues
    + Asymmetric gradient Problem
    + Size-dependent Keypoint Scoring Problem
<Callout>
__AlphaPose Solved these problems ann provided a new regression method for higher accuracy__
</Callout>

## Multi Person Pose Tracking
Pose Tracking is extended from multi person pose estimation in videos. It aim to linking corresponding individual body across multiple frames and output a sequence of poses and how it changed over time. A pose Tracker is usefull for action recognition tasks. 
Similar to Pose estimation, it also categorized in to __Topdown__ and __BottomUp__ approac

#### Limitation Of Previous Methods
- __Build temporal and Spatial graphs and solving optimization problem__ -> prevent graph-cut optimization from running in online manner -> Time consumming, memory-inefficient
- __Ultilizes 3D MaskRCNN to estimate person tube, poses simultaneously__ -> Input a whole video sequence -> enable online tracking.
- __Forward and Backward bounding box propagation strategy to eliminate essue of missed detection__  -> The same as above.

These methods rely on the spatial continuity of poses only.
#### Adopt Re-ID feature
- A pose-guided re-ID feature extraction is designed to avoid potential background noise.
- Multi-stage information merging method to ultilize boxes, poses, re-ID features simultaneously.

## Notes
- __Confidence Thresshold__
- __Localizing Keypoints__: process of joining keypoints (determine the relative position of keypoints in a human body).
- __NMS__ - Nonmax Supression: Eliminate the redundant Bounding box.
    + Discard all boxes with confidence < some threshold.
    + While there are any remaining boxes __Pick__ the highest confidence and __Discard__ any remain box with IoU > 0.5 (high overlap) with the box just picked.

- __ROI-Pooling__ -  align and pool the features from regions of interst in to a fixed size feature map
    + Input an image with corresponding feature map with ROIs (bounding boxes).
    + ROI-Pooling devides each ROI into fixed grid (2x2, 3x3, ..).
    + ROI-Pooling quantizes the location to the nearest feature map cell, and it pools the feature values in that cell.
    + Output a fixed-size representation for each ROI.

- __ROI-Align__ - __Region of Interest Align__, an improvement over ROI-Pooling method. Instead of quantizing the ROI locations on step 3,RO-Align uses bilinear interpolation to sample feature map at sub-pixel locations within the ROI and result in a more accurate alignment between the ROI and feature map. Then is typically pools or aggregates the features from the interpolated values to obtain a fixed-size representation for each ROI.
    + Improved spatial information.
    + Higher accurate localization of object boundaries which suitable for object detection task that previce object localization is crucial.
