## Introduction

Full body haman pose estimation is one of the fundamentals in computer visions field. With many different applications derived from it.

<Callout>
The survey only focus on top-down approach, which first detects human bounding boxes and then estimates the pose for each box.
</Callout>

#### Drawback
- __Top down__ approach's performances are dominant on common benchmarks.
- Detection state and esimator are separated so if Detection fail => No recover for the pose estimator.

#### Resolve draw back 
- Lower the detection confidence and NMS threshold _(can raise redundant boxes)_.
- Eliminated redundant boxes by a parametric pose NMS _(Using novel pose distance metric to compare pose similarity)_.
- Optimize with a data-diven approach .
- Spped up top-down framework by a multi-stage concurrent pipeline in AlphaPose that enable running in realtime.

#### Adopt Softargmax instead of Heatmap
Heatmap is most use approach for represent keypoints in the current.
##### Drawback of Heatmap
- One of the major problem is __Quantization error__.
- Unsuitable for __Localizeing keypoints__ of body, faces, hands simultaneously.
- __Draw back__ - Although Heatmaps are mostly used for keypoint representation. However, its size is usually quater of the input image. 
- Heatmap representation is discrete so it may miss the correct position (__not a problem in body-only estimation__. However not good for fine-level keypoints on hands, face).
##### Solution
Use __additional sub-networks__ for hand and face estimation and ROI-Align to enlarge the feature map are current solutions. However, both methods are computation expensive (especially for full body estimation).

__AlphaPose__ use a novel summetric integral keypoints regression method that can localize keypoints in different scales accurately.

    

## Notes
### ROI-Align
Region of Interest Align - an improvement over ROI-Pooling method (a method for align and pool the features from regions of interst in to a fixed size feature map).

__ROI-Pooling__
+ Input an image with corresponding feature map with ROIs (bounding boxes).
+ ROI-Pooling devides each ROI into fixed grid (2x2, 3x3, ..).
+ ROI-Pooling quantizes the location to the nearest feature map cell, and it pools the feature values in that cell.
+ Output a fixed-size representation for each ROI.

__Improvement__

Instead of quantizing the ROI locations on step 3,RO-Align uses bilinear interpolation to sample feature map at sub-pixel locations within the ROI and result in a more accurate alignment between the ROI and feature map.
Then is typically pools or aggregates the features from the interpolated values to obtain a fixed-size representation for each ROI.

- Improved spatial information.
- Higher accurate localization of object boundaries which suitable for object detection task that previce object localization is crucial.
