<Callout>
Heatmap based are currently the most used method for Pose Estimation. However, despite its good performance, there are some issues sush as non-differentiable post-processing or quantization error...
This post propose a simple __Integral operation__ for avoiding those issues as it is differrentiable, effiecient,...

## Heatmap Issues

{/* #### Another Point Of View
Pose estimation is essentially a regression problem -> it must be end-to-end training and continuous output.
###### Issues
- __Regression methods__ and __detection based methods are not effective for __2D Pose Estimation__. Possibly, because of the method dificulties.
- __Regression methods__ are suitable for 3D pose estimation. However, the performamce still low. */}

#### Operation
Given heat map $$H(K)$$ for $$K th$$ joint. Known that each location in the heatmap represent the probability of the location being the joint.
The final joint location coordinate is

In a simple term. It find the location with maximum value in the heatmap.

#### Issues
- The __taking-maximum__ operation is not differentiable -> cant be a component of learning -> prevents end-to-end traning.
- Quantization Error - lower resolution than that of input image (Because of Pooling step) and it is limited by the quantization factor.
- Large Heatmap can be used -> cost of extra storage, computation.

## Integral Regression
<Callout>
Modifies the __Taking maximum__ operation to __taking-expectation__. So the joint is estimated as the integration of all locations in the heatmap, weighted by their probabilities (normalized from likelihoods).
The Integral regression (Soft-argmax) is parameter free, only transforms the pose representation from heatmap to joint. __So it does not affect other algorithm and can be combined with any of them (or any tasks in the image below)__.

#### Advantages over Heatmap based
- Enable End-to-end.
- Output is continuous and up to arbitrary localization accuracy (solve the quantization problem).
#### Operation
Modify the __Max__ operation to take the __expectation__

## Notes
- __Quantization Erro__: Using discrete set for represent a continuous values.
