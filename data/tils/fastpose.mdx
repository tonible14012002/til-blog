## FastPose
#### Challenges
- Occlusion, intense light adn rare poses.
- Unconstrained videos such as camera motion, blur, view variants.

__Previous method__ address single prelocated person (eplout pictorial structures model, following deep channels)

#### Most used Method
__Two-states method__ are most used in this problems. Firstly detect, crop person from the image, then perform the single person pose estimation in the croped patches.

#### Issues
- Two-stages methods are scale invariant. The second stage only focuses on the keypoint detection task on a fixed scale.
- These methods cannot perform in real-time because of complex procedures (detection, cropping and scaling images, pose estimation).
- ...

## FastPose
#### Aims
- Peform Pose estimation.
- Tracking towards realtime speed.
#### Stack
- Multi-Task Network (MTN): jointly optimizes Human detection, pose estimation and person Re-ID simutaneously.
- Scale-Normalized paradigm is proposed to alleviate the scale variation problem for the multi-task network.
- Occlusion-aware Re-ID strategy is designed for articulateed multi-person pose tracking in video.
#### Main Contribution
- With Re-ID feature, design and end-to-end MTN (Multi-task Network)
- Propose new paradigm (Scale-normalized image and feature pyramid) to alleviating scale variation problem (bottleneck of unified top-down method in Pose Estimation).
- Base on image-pyramidm ignore estremely small or large objects to mkake sizes of objects uniformly distributed in the exact range.
- Combine feature pyramid networks (FPN) with scale distribution -> help the network to avoid multi-scale testing.
- Pose information (output from above MTN) utilized to inder occlusion state and achieve the occlusion-aware Re-ID -> Dramatically reduct the ID switches during tracking.
