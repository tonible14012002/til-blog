In Human Post Estimation problem, heatmap is the most used method for keypoints representation. However it raise a lot drawbacks because its oprator not differentiable so that prevents it traning from being end-to-end.
Heatmap  has lower resolution than the input image due to the down sampleing steps in deep NN -> __Inevitable Quantitation errors__. Meanwhile, a higher resolution results in computational problem.

## Integral Regression

## Symmetric Integral Keypoints Regression

#### Asymmetric Gradient Problem
_-Soft-argmax__ turns heatmap based approaches into regression based approaches and enable end-to-end traning.
